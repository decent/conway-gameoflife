# Conway's Game of Life

This is, at the moment, a console version in C of
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

The initial board can be found in the file **border.h** and is currently set up
with a static size.

So far this has only been tested under Ubuntu Linux, and uses printing an ANSI
code to clear the screen.

## Compilation

Compilation should hopefully only be a `make` away.
